        bio: 'Justine will say she is confused most of the time. She has a worrying fixation on cats and refuses to talk about any other subject during conversation. Yes, she does like other animals but just obsesses over the feline kind. Most hobby stores are on a first name basis with her, especially if they deal with nerdy franchises. She is trying really hard to be a designer but still has a long way to go. Justine enjoys long walks to her fridge and watching the sun set on her favourite characters dying.',
